Collection of the SNe Ia data as .csv files and each individual python 3 file used to compare the various models to the data. All of these models describe fairly simple situations, employing only 1, 2 or 3 free parameters. Many remarks, comments and explanations are presented in each file. The important characterstic of each model is the correlation between the actual SN Ia distance and the recession velocity of the associated galaxy. No modified values, such as distance mag,  were used.
